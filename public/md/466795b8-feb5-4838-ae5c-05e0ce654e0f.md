# Building a simple cryptocurrency blockchain in Javascript (part I)

### Building a very basic cryptocurrency blockchain in Javascript

Cryptocurrencies are all the rage at the moment and the demand for blockchain developers continues to spike up at a tremendous speed. The thing is, the blockchain isn't an exactly new concept but it is yet to gain massive adoption and it isn't too late to be a crypto prophet by answering the call to be a blockchain engineer. As Jesus of Nazareth would say in similar situations, "Know what is before you so that what is to come would become clearer. For what passes the eye is harbinger of what the mind must envision". While I am no being from heaven, I foresee a time the blockchain would permeate various sectors in our journey towards the utmost digitalization of said sectors. Now that I'm free of my drunkeness, I'd like to make clear what a blockchain is. The blockchain isn't a digital currency neither is it an financial contrivance. The blockchain is a digital ledger or chain of records called `blocks`. Think of the blockchain as a linked list on steroids. In this list, every record or block is magically, errrr, cryptographically linked to the record preceding it. Each record has a fingerprint or cryptographic representation of its content. This makes the blockchain an append-only unalterable list. In simpler terms, what enters a blockchain remains as it is for all time. It is digitally immortal and impeccable. Things only enter but never leave.

In blockchain, there's the concept of hashing or fingerprinting. Each block is assigned a `hash` of its content. This content includes the fingerprint of the parent block (i.e the block before this one). Every block (except the genesis block) must have a parent block. In some blockchains, two or more blocks could share ancestry or descent from a single block. The genesis block is the progenitor or the utmost parent of the blockchain. It is the only block without a prior block.

The concept of the blockchain is fairly simple to grasp. The major work lies in the coding aspect. One could develop a blockchain network with any language but for the scope of this article, it is assumed that the person reading this is a Javascript engineer.

The blockchain is a list of objects called blocks. In OOP, these objects would be represented by classes. For this article, we'll be using the ES6 standard. First, create a class named `Block` and place this class in any file. This class would look something like this:

```js
class Block {
 constructor(index, timestamp, previousHash, data) {
  this.index = index;
  this.timestamp = timestamp;
  this.previousHash = previousHash;
  this.data = data;
  this.hash = ...
 }
}
```

To calculate the hash of a block, we need an npm library called `crypto-js`. Install this library using npm:

```batch
npm install --save crypto-js
```

Now, add a function to calculate the hash of the block:

```js

const { SHA256 } = require("crypto-js");

class Block {
 constructor(index, timestamp, previousHash, data) {
  // Lines removed for clarity
  this.hash = this.calculateHash();
 }

 calculateHash() {
  return SHA256(this.index + this.timestamp + this.previousHash + JSON.stringify(this.data)).toString();
 }
}

module.exports = Block;
```

The `calculateHash` function uses the secure hashing algorithm to hash specific block information and then returns a string representation of the hash. Next we need to create the blockchain itself. It would simple be a class holding a field which ould be an array of block objects:

```js
const Block = ... // Require module

class BlockChain {
 constructor() {
  this.chain = [this.genesisBlock()];
 }

 genesisBlock() {
  return new Block(0, Date.now(), "0000", []);
 }

 addBlock(data) {
  const lastBlock = this.chain[this.chain.length - 1];
  this.chain = [...this.chain, new Block(lastBlock.index + 1, Date.now(), lastBlock.hash, data)];
 }

 getChain() {
  return this.chain;
 }
}

module.exports = BlockChain;
```

The `genesisBlock` function generates the genesis block, the foundational block of any blockchain ecosystem. Note that the genesis block's previous hash is hardcoded as it has no block preceding it. The `addBlock` function adds a new block in the chain. Within this function, we access the last block in the chain, get its index and increment it by 1 and use the resulting number as the index of the currently forged block. We also access the hash of the last block in the chain and make it the value of the `previousHash` in the next block. After the values have been supplied for the next block, it is then appended to the chain. To test what has been done so far,

```js
const BlockChain = ... // Require module

const chain = new BlockChain();

chain.addBlock([{ from: "alex", to: "benjamin", amount: 3.4 }]);
chain.addBlock([{ from: "alex", to: "presley", amount: 1.4 }]);
chain.addBlock([{ from: "kieran", to: "jericho", amount: 0.1 }]);

console.log(chain.getChain());
```

Run the above program with `node FILE_NAME`. You should see the entire chain logged on the console. This is a very basic cryptocurrency blockchain. In subsequent parts, we'll be seeing more advance stuffs like the implementation of the Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm and some actual transaction signing and verification.
